                <div class="rule-decoration"></div>

                <p>Kinder Minds is founded by Dr. Sarah Castle, a Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist with expertise in children and adolescents' mental health, and Edoardo Giorgi, the administrative director with a rich background in nuclear science. This partnership is the cornerstone of our clinic, dedicated to providing exceptional mental health care and supporting families through their healing journey, focusing on the unique needs of each young person we serve.</p>

                <p>At the core of our clinic's mission is Sarah, whose deep passion and extensive training in psychiatry form the backbone of Kinder Minds' therapeutic approach. Originally from the United Kingdom and now based in New Zealand, she has refined her expertise through rigorous training at Imperial College London and further specialisation at the Tavistock Clinic in North London. Sarah's commitment to her field is evident in her holistic and innovative treatment methods, which address a spectrum of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, and trauma. Her philosophy centres on understanding the intricate worlds of young people, fostering an environment where their concerns, dreams, and challenges are met with empathy and expert care.</p>

                <p>Edoardo, transitioning from nuclear science to lead Kinder Minds' operations, blends scientific precision with compassionate oversight. His commitment to a supportive environment is evident in his calm demeanour, meticulous attention to detail, and transparent communication. Edoardo ensures that our clinic's administrative framework actively supports the therapeutic process, making every family's journey with us feel informed, supported, and valued. </p>
