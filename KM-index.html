                <p>Kinder Minds is founded by Dr. Sarah Castle, a Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist with profound expertise in children and adolescents' mental health, and Edoardo Giorgi, the administrative director with a rich background in nuclear science. This partnership is the cornerstone of our clinic, dedicated to providing exceptional mental health care and supporting families through their healing journey, focusing on the unique needs of each young person we serve.</p>

                <p>At the core of our clinic's mission is Sarah, whose deep passion and extensive training in psychiatry form the backbone of Kinder Minds' therapeutic approach. Originally from the United Kingdom and now based in New Zealand, she has refined her expertise through rigorous training at Imperial College London and further specialization at the Tavistock Clinic in North London. Sarah's commitment to her field is evident in her holistic and innovative treatment methods, which address a spectrum of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, and trauma. Her philosophy centres on understanding the intricate worlds of young people, fostering an environment where their concerns, dreams, and challenges are met with empathy and expert care.</p>

                <p>Edoardo, transitioning from nuclear science to lead Kinder Minds' operations, blends scientific precision with compassionate oversight. His commitment to a supportive environment is evident in his calm demeanour, meticulous attention to detail, and transparent communication. Edoardo ensures that our clinic's administrative framework actively supports the therapeutic process, making every family's journey with us informed, supported, and valued. </p>

                    <p>Dr. Sarah Castle is at the heart of Kinder Minds' approach and commitment to helping young people and their families overcome the mental health challenges they face. Sarah brings an abundant wealth of psychiatric and therapeutic expertise gained through her extensive training and specialisation as well as experience running services such as her recent position as Clinical Head of Department for Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Early intervention in Psychosis, Maternal Infant Mental Health and Forensic CAMHS Services, in Te Tai Tokerau DHB across Northland.</p>

                    <p>Alongside formal clinical training, Sarah is passionate about working alongside families and Young People, to understand their inner world, concerns, worries, fantasies and dreams matter by giving them a voice. She often tries to work creativity and works outside of a one size fits all approach, to connect with ‘hard to reach’ children and young people.</p>

                    <p>Sarah has a keen interest in the assessment and treatment of trauma and neurodiversity, including ASD and ADHD. Her expertise is broadened by additional training in Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), Mentalization Based Therapy for Adolescents, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for trauma, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, and other talking therapies. Sarah is particularly skilled in supporting young people through the diagnostic process, including ADOS-II, and offering interventions that benefit them and their families post-diagnosis, showcasing her comprehensive approach to mental health care.</p>
